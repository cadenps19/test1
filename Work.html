        <h1>Current Day</h1>
        <p>After my days of building/breaking computers,
            I told myself I was going to go to college to learn all
            I could about the technological age. I have learned so
            much already and can’t wait to continue to grow through
            the next few years of classes. These classes will benefit
            me in the long run of my career even if I don’t think it will
            be worth it now… Calculus….

            <h2>Previous Job Experience</h2>
            <h3>City of Springfield Environmental Services — CONTRACT WORKER</h3>
            <p>At my current job with the City of Springfield working in Environmental Services I repair and maintain
                sewer
                mains throughout the city.
                My responsibilities are self-initiating. When I get to my job I start out by cleaning out our truck and
                preparing our tools and supplies for
                the day's task. Then I proceed to fuel up the work truck, skid steer, track hoe, backhoe, and the
                excavator.
                I then load the machines onto their
                respective trailers and connect the trailers to the tandem dump trucks. Then I gather the required
                materials
                for the build, including: fernco couplings,
                lateral hookups, glue and primer, 8 inch and 4 inch PVC pipe required for the sewer repair. I make sure
                to
                talk to the home-owners yard we will be working
                in to make certain that they will be happy with the work we will be doing so as to not cause an
                inconvenience. I then make sure to Keep a safe working environment
                while the operator uses various machines as stated previously to dig a safe hole to work in. Once the
                hole
                is dug by the operator and I have followed and maintained
                the safety protocols, such as shoring the hole properly, cleaning up the area around the hole to ensure
                nothing falls in when not intended, and wearing personal
                protective equipment. I proceed to go down the hole and clean around the broken pipe so I can then
                replace
                it with the new pipe to keep everyone's sewer working
                to the expected degree. Once the job is completed it is important to me to go to the home owner and make
                sure that they are satisfied with the work. I finish
                off my day by cleaning the tools we used and getting the machines ready for the next day's work.

            <h3>DOMINO’S PIZZA — DELIVERY DRIVER</h3>
            <p>
                While working at Domino’s as a delivery driver my responsibilities included: the timely delivery of
                given
                orders,
                receiving orders from the counter, the drive through, and over the phone; and cash transactions. After
                my
                daily tasks were completed
                I would then proceed to: stock the produce line, assist with pizza making and prep, prepare the boxes
                for
                each order, cut the pizza and box
                it up, assist other drivers to ensure the customers get their orders in a timely manner, wash dishes,
                and
                ensure the line was ready for the
                next shift of drivers.
