        <img src="Baby.PNG" alt="photo of creator during childhood">
        <p>When I was young, I was always fascinated by computers. I would always try to understand how they worked.
            I would take old broken computers and try to take them apart and fix them. It normally ended up with me
            breaking them more.
            I would try all I could to understand how they would work. I hate researching, but something about my
            younger self would
            love to spend all my free time researching how computers work. When I was 12 I built my first computer and
            if I wasnâ€™t hooked before,
            I was after that. That was one of my favorite things to do and I told myself I wanted to do that for a job.
            The schooling I am currently
            doing is completing a promise for my past self to do all I can to work in the computer industry.
